    <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
    <p>Crème brûlée is a classic French dessert known for its smooth and velvety custard base, infused with vanilla, and topped with a layer of caramelized sugar. The distinctive touch comes from torching the sugar to create a crisp, golden crust that contrasts beautifully with the creamy custard beneath.</p>
    <h2><em>Recipe</em></h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped (or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract)</li>
            <li>5 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>Extra sugar for caramelizing</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F (163°C). Place ramekins in a baking dish and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a saucepan, heat the heavy cream and vanilla over medium heat until it simmers. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until well combined.</li>
            <li>Slowly pour the warm cream mixture into the egg mixture, stirring constantly to avoid curdling.</li>
            <li>Strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a pouring jug to remove any lumps or the vanilla pod.</li>
            <li>Pour the custard into the ramekins in the baking dish and fill the dish with hot water halfway up the sides of the ramekins.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 40-45 minutes or until the custard is set but still slightly jiggly in the center.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a thin, even layer of sugar on top of each custard and caramelize using a kitchen torch until golden and crispy.</li>
            <li>Allow the caramelized sugar to harden, and serve the crème brûlée immediately.</li>
        </ol>
